We eat, drink, sleep and most importantly love **DevOps**. DevOps always promotes automation and standardisation. While setting up various environments like local, dev, testing, production, etc. it is critical to maintain the same environment across. This can easily be achieved using automating the environment setup & installation with the help of ansible-playbooks.

Smaller roles are created for each environment elements; which also include tasks & tests. These roles can then be grouped together in [ansible-playbook](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_intro.html) to achieve the desired yet consistent results.



## Prerequisites

This module has a few dependencies:

- [Ansible2.8](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads)
- [Molecule](https://molecule.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu)




## What Includes

Followiing things includes in this role:
- Nginx





## Examples

**IMPORTANT:** Since the `master` branch used in `source` varies based on new modifications, we suggest that you use the release versions [here](https://github.com/clouddrove/ansible-role-nginx/releases).


### Simple Example
For including the role in your playbook this is the basic configuration:
```ansible
    - hosts: localhost
      remote_user: root
      become: true
      roles:
        - ansible-role-nginx
```




## Testing


In this module testing is performed with [molecule](https://molecule.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) and it is designed to aid in the development and testing of Ansible roles with multiple instances, operating systems and distributions, virtualization providers, test frameworks and testing scenarios.

You need to run the following command in the root of Ansible Role:
```molecule
  molecule test
```
